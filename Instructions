Instructions on how to start each project: 

1. cd into the project's server or client depending on which one you want to work on
2. Type into the terminal the following command: npm start
This command will start the server or start the client (aka the website)
3. ALWAYS START THE SERVER BEFORE THE CLIENT IF CREATING NEW CODE (Code may crash otherwise)



When taking new code from Github: 

1. Click on the code button and download the Zip file
2. Go to your downloads folder on your computer and move it to wherever you keep the projects locally
3. Open the new project in Visual Studio Code and add a file called .env to both the server and the client
The .env files should be in your previous project, so just copy and paste their content into the new files you just created
4. Make sure you run the following command in both the server and the client on terminal: npm install
This will install the npm modules which consist of all the commands and files you will need for the project
